## 🎓 Key Concepts

### What is RAG-Powered Budgeting?
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) means our AI searches a real database of products and materials to give you accurate, real-world pricing. It's not just guessing—it's matching your design to actual items you can buy!

### Why Multiple Renders?
Different angles and lighting help you visualize how your space will look at different times of day and from different viewpoints.

### Can I Edit After Generation?
Yes! You can always create a new design with adjusted preferences. Each generation is unique.

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Take a Clear Photo**: Use good lighting and capture the full area you want to redesign
2. **Be Specific**: The more details you provide in preferences, the better the AI can match your vision
3. **Mix Styles**: Don't be afraid to select multiple style references for a unique blend
4. **Save Variations**: Generate multiple designs with different styles to compare
5. **Check the Plan**: The 2D plan is great for showing contractors exactly what you want
